# This section prepares the model. It's best to have it at the top.

# 1. The original dataset provided by the user.
# In a real-world app, this might be loaded from a file or database.

    'Total Hardness (ppm)': [1590, 1390, 1460, 1430, 1430, 1400, 1500, 1510, 1430, 1480, 1270, 1190, 1390, 1390],

# 2. Define features (X) and target (y).
features = ['Conductivity (ÂµS/cm)', 'pH']
target = 'Total Hardness (ppm)'

X = df[features]

# 3. Initialize and train the Random Forest model.
# We use the entire dataset for training to make the best possible
# predictor based on the limited data available.
# random_state ensures the model is consistent every time it runs.
rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

    - **Model Used:** `Random Forest Regressor`. This is a powerful machine learning model that works by building a multitude of decision trees and averaging their outputs. This "wisdom of the crowd" approach generally leads to more accurate and stable predictions compared to a single decision tree.
    - **Training Data:** The model was trained on the 14 data points you provided.
    - **Features:** The model uses two features for its prediction: `Conductivity (ÂµS/cm)` and `pH`.
